# Practical Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository is a collection of my work for the PHP2550: Practical Data Analysis course. It compiles the final and updated versions of all three projects over the semester, demonstrating my skills in data analysis, statistical modeling, and collaboration. 

## Repository Structure
Each project within this repository is organized to ensure ease of navigation. Every folder contains a detailed `README` file offering deeper insights into the respective project. The structure for each folders includes:

- Code: This directory houses all the scripts and code used in each project.
- Images: A collection of images used in each report.
- Project Report PDF: The final compiled report of the project, illustrating all findings and analyses.
- README: A file providing an overview of the project, its objectives, and key findings

### Project 1
In collaboration with Dr. Lauren Micalizzi from the Department of Behavioral and Social Sciences, this project explores the impact of Smoking during Pregnancy (SDP) and Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) on children's behavioral outcomes. It addresses a critical public health issue, focusing on exploratory data analysis.

### Project 2
Working alongside Dr. Chris Schmid from the Biostatistics Department, this project focuses on developing prediction models to predict tracheostomy needs or the risk of death in neonates with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (sBPD). 

### Project 3
In collaboration with Dr. Jon Steingrimsson, this project focuses on assessing the transportability of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk prediction models. It involves the direct transportability of models developed using data from the Framingham Heart Study when applied to the NHANES target population. This is direct approach is compared to a simulated transportability analysis using simulated NHANES data. This project offers insights on how simulation studies can be used as effective methods to measure transportability.
