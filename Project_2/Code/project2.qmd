## **Abstract**

This project, in collaboration with Dr. Chris Schmid from the Biostatistics Department at Brown, targets a vital area in neonatal healthcare: determining the optimal timing for tracheostomy in neonates with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (sBPD). Tracheostomy, essential for aiding breathing in these infants, has lacked clear, data-driven guidelines for its timing. Utilizing a comprehensive national dataset, we analyzed demographic, diagnostic, and respiratory parameters of infants with sBPD at two critical post-menstrual ages -- 36 and 44 weeks.

Our analysis revealed that models incorporating 44-week data were superior in predicting the need for tracheostomy or the risk of death compared to those using only up to 36-week data. The best-performing models, using Lasso and Forward Selection at 44 weeks, achieved an accuracy of 86%. These model's success is attributed to key predictors such as birth length, delivery method, prenatal steroid use, ventilation support level, and inspired oxygen fraction, underscoring the intricate relationship between prenatal and postnatal health in sBPD outcomes.

This work lays a critical data-driven foundation for future model development, aiming to enhance clinical decision-making and improve outcomes for vulnerable neonates. It marks a first step in addressing the challenge of tracheostomy timing in sBPD, providing a springboard for further investigation and model refinement in neonatal care.

## **1. Introduction**

#### 1.1 Background on Tracheostomy in Severe BPD

Severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (sBPD) in neonates is a critical lung condition characterized by underdeveloped lungs, often necessitating extensive respiratory support. Tracheostomy, a surgical procedure to create a direct airway, plays a pivotal role in the management of these fragile patients by facilitating long-term ventilation and improved breathing. However, the decision regarding the timing of tracheostomy is complex. Early intervention carries the risk of unnecessary surgical complications, while delayed tracheostomy might delay essential respiratory support, potentially increasing the risk of mortality. (Sushmita, 2021) This project, in collaboration with Dr. Chris Schmid from Brown's Biostatistics Department, focuses on identifying the optimal timing for tracheostomy in neonates with sBPD, aiming to balance immediate respiratory needs against long-term developmental outcomes.

#### 1.2 Dataset Overview

The dataset for this project is a dense compilation of data from neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) across the nation, encompassing a wide range of variables. This data came from a retrospective case-control study conducted in 2018 conducted across nine centers focusing on infants born at â‰¤32 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA). The dataset is a comprehensive compilation of variables critical to neonatal health. It includes demographic details such as maternal race (`mat_race`) and ethnicity (`mat_ethn`), medical details like birth weight (`bw`), gestational age (`ga`), and various measures of neonatal health and treatment at 36 and 44 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA). These latter measures include weight at specific weeks (`weight_today.36`, `weight_today.44`), levels of ventilation support (`ventilation_support_level.36`, `ventilation_support_level_modified.44`), and other critical respiratory parameters (e.g., `inspired_oxygen.36`, `p_delta.36`). The primary outcomes of interest in this study are tracheostomy or mortality rates at discharge, providing critical insights into the optimal timing for tracheostomy in neonates with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

#### 1.3 Project Overview

The project began with thorough data cleaning, establishing a solid foundation for subsequent analysis. This was followed by an exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, where we examined patterns and correlations between various predictors and the key outcome---tracheostomy or death in neonates with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (sBPD).

To tackle the issue of missing data, we implemented multiple imputation and removed cases where large amounts of 44 week variables were missing. Our analytical approach was divided into settings, focusing on the data until the post-menstrual ages of 36 and 44 weeks, to account for the progression of neonatal health. For each setting we developed models using Lasso and Forward Stepwise Logistic Regression, fitting and evaluating these methods across each of the five imputed datasets. The models were then averaged to ensure generalizability and robustness. Finally, we assessed the model evaluations metrics we used such as accuracy, F1-score, specificity, sensitivity, AUC, and Brier score. This varied assessment provided crucial insights for clinical decision-making and underscored the significance of data-driven analysis in neonatal healthcare.

## **2. Methods**

### 2.1 Data Preprocessing

For data preprocessing, involved transforming various variables into binary or multilevel factor formats for consistency. For instance, the `Death` variable was recoded to '1' for 'Yes' and '0' for 'No'. Other binary predictors, such as prenatal steroid use (`prenat_ster`), complete prenatal steroids (`com_prenat_ster`), maternal chorioamnionitis (`mat_chorio`), small for gestational age status (`sga`), surfactant usage (`any_surf`), delivery method (`del_method`), and `gender`, were similarly encoded. To address our research questions effectively, we created a composite outcome variable to represent the combined incidence of tracheostomy or death. This approach was necessitated by the limited cases exclusively involving death ('Death Only') or both tracheostomy and death ('Trach and Death'). The outcome was defined as '0' for scenarios involving neither death nor tracheostomy, and '1' for either outcome.

Data cleaning also involved rectifying anomalies and removing non-essential information. For example, an implausibly low recorded weight of 3 grams at 44 weeks was marked as missing. We discovered and removed duplicate records and missing `center` values were filled based on the `record_id`. Hospital Discharge Gestational Age (`hosp_dc_ga`) was also excluded as it would not be known in practical use of these models. Lastly, irrelevant variables such as `record_id`, `Death`, `Trach`, and `mat_race` (due to data collection issues) were omitted to streamline the dataset for analysis.

### 2.2 Exploratory Data Analysis

![](Images/table1.jpg){width="399"}

Our exploratory data analysis began with an examination of descriptive statistics of predictors between our different outcomes. As seen in the above table, we compared key variables between neonates who did not require tracheostomy or did not experience death (Outcome 0) and those who did (Outcome 1). This comparison encompassed a range of predictors in the dataset. Notable distinctions were observed in infant weight, small for gestational age (SGA) status, and respiratory support metrics such as Peak Inspiratory Pressure and Ventilation at both 36 and 44 weeks. These differences provided preliminary insights into the factors that might influence the likelihood of tracheostomy or death.

![Correlation Matrix of Continuous Predictors](Images/corr.jpg){width="341"}

In our correlation analysis, shown in the Figure 1, we assessed the relationship between continuous predictors. The results indicated that variables measured at 36 weeks had a strong correlation with the variables collected at 44 weeks. This relationship was also seen in data collected at birth such as birth weight and gestational age. Interestingly many of these variables collected at birth were negatively correlated to variables at 36 weeks, which is to be expected as neonates that are younger and lighter typically have increased rates of complications. (Sushmita, 2021) Interestingly this correlation decreases at the 44-week level, which can be attributed to the dynamic nature of neonate health.

To visually illustrate differences in predictors between the outcomes, we generated two plots focusing on key respiratory measures.

![Distribution of Peak Inspiratory Pressure Oxygen by Outcome](Images/plot1.jpg){width="269"}

Figure 2 displays the distribution of peak inspiratory pressure at 36 weeks post-menstrual age in relation to the outcome. For infants classified under Outcome 0, the distribution is primarily concentrated at lower pressure values, with a few outliers at higher pressure levels. However, in the Outcome 1 group, the distribution is more evenly spread, with a noticeable presence of medium to high values. This pattern indicates a higher likelihood of adverse outcomes (tracheostomy or death) associated with increased inspiratory pressures at this age.

![Distribution of Inspired Oxygen by Outcome](Images/plot2.jpg){width="269"}

Figure 3 examines the fraction of inspired oxygen at 36 weeks. Similar to the findings on inspiratory pressure, infants in the Outcome 0 group predominantly fall into the lower fraction range, as evidenced by a left-skewed distribution. In contrast, the distribution for infants with Outcome 1 is less skewed and encompasses a broader range of higher oxygen fraction values.

![Proportion of Outcomes by Center](Images/center.jpg){width="270"}

Lastly, Figure 4 presents the proportions of outcomes (tracheostomy or mortality) at each NICU center. This figure highlights notable differences in outcomes across centers, suggesting a potential variability in clinical practices, resource availability, or patient demographics that might influence the risk of adverse outcomes. While these differences could be modeled as random effects, this approach was not easily feasible due to sample size issues at some centers. For instance, there was a large difference in the number of observations from different centers, with approximately 630 observations coming from Center 2, but only 5 from Center 20. This disparity, along with our aim to develop models that are generalizable across various centers, led to the decision to exclude center-specific factors from our analysis.

### 2.3 Missing Data

![](Images/table2.jpg){width="233"}

From the table above we can see that, approximately 40% of the data lacked complete information for the 44-week variables, this pattern of missing data typically occurred together. This can be attributed to various factors such as early hospital discharge, death, or information not being recorded. The variable `any_surf` also exhibited a significantly high rate of missing data but did not follow the same pattern as the other variables and was subsequently excluded from the analyses since imputing this variable would introduce large bias. Beyond these, only three other variables---`comp_prenat_ster`, `p_delta.36`, and `peep_cm_h2o_modified.36`---had missing values exceeding 10%. These three variables were also seen to be correlated with other 36 week data, which would give us more certainty when using methods such as multiple imputation. Notably, our primary outcome variable and all other predictors showed minimal to no missing data.

Given the project's aim to develop and compare models for 36 and 44 weeks, the decision was taken to create two seperate datasets one with only data collected at 36 weeks, and another where observations missing 44-week variables were omitted. This was done to prevent the potential introduction of significant bias that might arise from imputing a large fraction of missing data for the data collected at 44-weeks. This led to reduction in the sample size from 994 for the 36-week dataset to a final 572 observations for the 44 weeks dataset after cleaning. Additionally, it is important to note that this adjustment altered the balance of outcomes in our dataset. Initially, the distribution was 82% for outcome = 0 and 18% for outcome = 1. After omitting certain observations, the final proportions shifted to 77% for outcome = 0 and 23% for outcome = 1.

To address the remaining missing data, multiple imputation was utilized to create five completed sets of data for the 36 and 44-week datasets. Following this, models were then applied to each of these datasets, and the results were averaged to ensure a balanced representation in our analysis. This methodology was key in enhancing the robustness of our findings and minimizing potential bias introduced by missing data.

### 2.4 Model Development

In the model development phase of this project, a total of four models were trained: two using the 36-week data and two using the 44-week data. Each of these models was fit to each of the five imputed datasets. The models selected for this study were Lasso and Forward Stepwise Logistic Regression, each chosen for their unique attributes in handling regression analysis and variable selection.

Lasso Regression promotes simplicity in models by shrinking coefficients, as well as promoting sparsity in models by outright setting certain variables to have coefficients of 0. For Lasso we utilized 10-fold cross-validation to determine the optimal lambda value, the tuning parameter that controls the strength of the penalty applied to each model. Additionally, Forward Stepwise Regression was also used for variable selection when creating our model. This method incrementally added variables based on the AIC, focusing on the variables that would lead to the most significant model improvements. (Hastie, 2020)

By utilizing these models, the analysis aimed to identify the most significant predictors for tracheostomy or death in neonates with sBPD, while maintaining model sparsity, key for model interpretation. To perform model selection, each of the five imputed datasets was used to fit the models. After this, the coefficients and evaluation metrics were averaged across these datasets, to further ensure that the results were robust and generalizable across different potential scenarios in the dataset.

The 36-week model coefficients, as presented, illustrate the distinct methodologies of Forward Stepwise and Lasso Logistic Regression in variable selection and weighting. The Forward Stepwise model is notably sparse, including only variables with the most statistically significant contributions, as evidenced by its inclusion of 11 non-zero coefficients. Similarly Lasso both shrunk coefficients along with variable selection, resulting in approximately 15 non-zero variables.

Key variables like **`ventilation_support_level.36`** and **`inspired_oxygen.36`** are significantly weighted across both models, highlighting their crucial role in predicting outcomes, consistent with their direct relevance to respiratory health in neonates. Other variables such as **`prenat_ster`** (prenatal steroid use), **`ga`** (gestational age), **`peep_cm_h2o_modified.36`** (Positive and exploratory pressure), and **`med_ph.36`** (Medication for Pulmonary Hypertension) also show consistency across models, indicating a greater likelihood of outcome. Interestingly, variables like **`del_method`**, **`mat_chorio`**, and **`com_prenat_ster`** are selected in Lasso but not in Forward Stepwise, highlighting the different methodologies in handling predictors with varying statistical significance.

The 44-week models incorporates similar variables to the 36-week models, however, shifts importances towards 44 week variables especially in Lasso. Forward Stepwise remains the sparser model, selecting only 11 out of 23 variables as significant. Lasso again demonstrates coefficient shrinkage while also performing variable selection, choosing to include 14 non-zero coefficients in the final model. Similar to the 36-week model, key predictors like ventilation support at both 36 and 44 weeks, `del_method` (delivery method), and `prenat_ster` were integral in training. Interestingly variables previously selected such as weight at 36 weeks and `peep_cm_h2o_modified.36` were excluded, this shift in variable importance potentially reflects the developmental changes in neonates health over time.

### 3.2 Model Performance

**36-Week Models**

| Metric      | Fwd Step | Lasso  |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| Accuracy    | 0.8414   | 0.8424 |
| F1 Score    | 0.6967   | 0.7000 |
| Brier Score | 0.1586   | 0.1576 |
| AUC         | 0.9090   | 0.9095 |
| Sensitivity | 0.9474   | 0.9526 |
| Specificity | 0.8163   | 0.8163 |
| Threshold   | 0.1822   | 0.1783 |

**44-Week Models**

| Metric      | Fwd Step | Lasso  |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| Accuracy    | 0.8526   | 0.8649 |
| F1 Score    | 0.7241   | 0.7431 |
| Brier Score | 0.1473   | 0.1351 |
| AUC         | 0.9131   | 0.9154 |
| Sensitivity | 0.9083   | 0.9250 |
| Specificity | 0.8377   | 0.8489 |
| Threshold   | 0.2816   | 0.1817 |

In comparing the Forward Stepwise and Lasso models for both the 36-week and 44-week datasets, each model demonstrates unique strengths and weaknesses. Accuracy, a measure of the overall correctness of the model, is relatively similar across all models, indicating a consistent level of general predictive ability, however is slightly higher among 44-week models. The F1 score, which balances precision and recall, is slightly higher in the 44-week models compared to the 36-week models, suggesting minor improvement in identifying true positives and negatives at this later time point.

The Brier score, a measure of the accuracy of probabilistic predictions, also shows slight improvements in the 44-week models, indicating more accurate probability estimates for the outcomes. The AUC (Area Under the Curve) reflects the model's ability to discriminate between the two classes (tracheostomy/death vs. none). Higher AUC values in the 44-week models suggest better discriminative power at this stage. Sensitivity, or the true positive rate, is significantly higher in the 36-week models, especially in the Lasso model, indicating a stronger ability to correctly identify neonates who need tracheostomy or are at risk of death. Comparitively, specificity, or the true negative rate, is higher in the 44-week models, with Lasso showing the highest specificity.

Comparing the 36-week and 44-week models reveals that the models developed using the 44-week data generally outperform those only using the 36-week data across most metrics, except in sensitivity. The 44-week Lasso model stands out for its balance between sensitivity and specificity, making it particularly adept at minimizing false positives---important in preventing unnecessary surgical interventions. On the other hand, the Lasso model at 36 weeks shows the best sensitivity, indicating its strength in minimizing false negatives. This is crucial in a clinical context, as a false negative could mean a missed opportunity for timely tracheostomy, potentially leaving a neonate without necessary respiratory support. In neonatal care, this balance between avoiding unnecessary procedures (false positives) and ensuring necessary interventions are not missed (false negatives) is vital. The choice of model in a clinical setting would heavily realy on whether the priority is to minimize risk of unnecessary surgery or to ensure neonates in need of intervention are accurately identified.

## **4. Limitations**

While this report yields important insights, it is important to acknowledge several limitations that may impact the interpretation and applicability of the project's findings. A primary limitation of this study is the significant amount of missing data, leading to a reduced sample size for analysis. From an initial pool of 994 observations, only 572 complete records could be utilized for the 44-week models. This reduction in sample size not only raises concerns about the predicitive power of these models but also their generalizability. Additionally, while techniques like multiple imputation were used to mitigate the effects of missing data, these methods cannot fully compensate for the lack of information, especially when the missingness is not random and is potentially related to underlying systemic factors in neonatal care.

Secondly, each regression model used in this study has inherent limitations that must also be considered. The Forward Stepwise model, for instance, may exclude variables that, while not statistically significant, could be clinically important, such as birth weight. Lasso regressions, known for handling multicollinearity, might also oversimplify complex relationships through coefficient reduction. These model-specific constraints highlight the need for careful interpretation of the results and suggest that reliance on any single model may provide an incomplete picture.

Lastly, the study's external validity is another area of concern. The data, derived from specific neonatal intensive care centers, may not fully represent the broader neonatal population or encompass the diversity data collected from outside healthcare environments. This limitation can affect the applicability of the study's conclusions to different settings or populations. Overall, these limitations underscore the need for further research and careful consideration in the clinical application of any findings.

## 5. **Conclusion**

This report is the first step in creating a data-driven understanding of tracheostomy timing in neonates with severe BPD. Utilizing a national dataset and three statistical models---Forward Stepwise and Lasso Logistic Regression---we've identified key variables such as ventilation support, inspired oxygen levels, and various other prenatal and postnatal factors that are critical in predicting the need for tracheostomy and associated mortality risks. Significantly, our analysis indicates that data from 44 weeks post-menstrual age yield models with higher specificity, while models using 36 week data have higher sensitivity.

This project should be viewed as a preliminary exploration, highlighting the potential for developing a clinically applicable model in the future. The limitations, including substantial missing data and the specific constraints of each statistical model, weaken the immediate applicability of our findings. Moreover, the report's scope, confined to a particular dataset, may not fully capture the diversity of the neonatal population or different healthcare settings.

Despite these challenges, our work shows a path for future research. It underscores the value of analytical approaches in neonatal care and points to the need for more extensive data collection and nuanced analysis. By continuing this research, the aim should be to refine these predictive models, making them robust enough for clinical application.
