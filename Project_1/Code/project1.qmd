## **Abstract**

This project, in collaboration with Dr. Lauren Micalizzi, investigates the impact of Smoking During Pregnancy (SDP) and Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) on children's behavior. Utilizing data from a smoke avoidance intervention study, this work focuses on a subset of adolescents and their mothers. The main objectives include analyzing statistical data for outliers and missing information, formulating exposure variables for SDP and ETS, exploring their interrelationship, and assessing the effects on child behavior outcomes such as self-regulation, externalizing behaviors, and substance use.

Key findings show substantial correlations among exposure variables and significant relationships between ETS and SDP and children's self-regulation and externalizing behaviors. Preliminary analyses reveal a possible negative impact of both SDP and ETS on these behavioral outcomes. The study's methodology involved cleaning and preparing data, followed by basic regression analysis. A notable limitation of the study is the presence of substantial missing data, particularly in variables related to smoking exposure and child substance use, which raises concerns about the reliability and generalizability of the findings.

## **1. Introduction**

Exposure to Smoke During Pregnancy (SDP) and Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) poses significant health risks to children. Dr. Lauren Micalizzi's study (Knopik, 2022) seeks to understand the effects of SDP and ETS on children's behavior. Participants were sourced from a prior smoke avoidance intervention study involving low-income women, with a subset of adolescents and their mothers selected for this research. A pivotal aspect of this study is the breakdown of survey questions into three key behavioral categories: self-regulation (SR), externalizing (EXT), and substance use (SU). This categorization is integral to the study, as it allows for a nuanced analysis of the behavioral impacts that exposure to tobacco smoke in prenatal and early life stages can have on children.

The primary objectives for this report include analyses of descriptive statistics to identify and manage outliers and missing data and the development of composite exposure variables for both SDP and ETS and outcome variables for SR, SU, and EXT. A key focus is to explore the complex relationships between these exposures and their potential effects on children's developmental outcomes. Through initial regression analyses, the study aims to understand how prenatal and postnatal tobacco smoke exposure might shape behavioral trajectories, providing insights into the long-term impacts of early life exposure to smoke.

## **2. Data Cleanliness and Quality**

This project utilizes a dataset consisting of 78 variables from 49 participants. This dataset encompasses a broad range of variables, including participant identifiers, detailed child-specific variables (covering demographics, language, ethnic background, and substance use behaviors), and behavioral assessments (such as attention, externalizing, and internalizing problems). Additionally, it features extensive parental data, including demographics, employment, education, income, substance use, and detailed smoking habits during and after pregnancy. The dataset also incorporates measures of smoke exposure for both mother and child, gauged through self-reports and biological markers like urine cotinine levels. Finally, it includes parental behavioral assessments, paralleling those of the children. This data forms the foundation of this project, allowing for our exploration of the effects of prenatal and postnatal smoke exposure on child and parental behavior.

**2.1 Data Cleaning**

A clean dataset, free from errors and inconsistencies, provides a solid foundation for analysis. To begin the data cleaning process, various inconsistencies were addressed to ensure the data's reliability and usability. Income data, which was originally recorded in a mix of formats, underwent standardization. Income values were converted to numeric forms, and an outlier value of "760" was removed, assuming it to be a mistyped value. The column detailing the mother's daily cigarette consumption, `mom_numcig`, had several ambiguous entries like "None", ranges such as "20-25", and erroneous data like "2 black and miles a day" which were adjusted to numerical values of 0, 22, and 2 respectively. An improbable value of "44989" within the same column was marked as NA.

Further cleaning included the binary conversion of certain columns, specifically those related to child ETS exposure. These columns were transformed from textual formats "1=Yes" and "2=No" to a binary system: 1 for "Yes" and 0 for "No". When examining the SWAN scores, entries with scores of 0 in both hyperactive and inattentive tests were marked as NA, based on patterns observed with other missing data. Finally, to simplify the dataset binary race indicator variables were merged into singular columns, `p_race`, and `t_race`, with biracial being and additional categorization.

### **2.2 Missing Data**

![](images/missing_data.jpg){width="241"}

From the table above, one notable limitation of the dataset is the prevalence of missing data. Several columns possess more than 25% missing entries with all variables missing at least a few entries. This is a substantial concern given the sample size of only 49. Furthermore, the pattern of missing data across certain variables suggests the missingness is not at random, caused by unobserved factors, such as the method of data collection or the population's characteristics. Upon further investigation 8 observations were found to contribute significantly to this missingness.

Additionally, `mom_smoke_pp1`, indicating if the mother smoked postpartum, has 79.59% missing data. While not as extreme, this is consistent with other smoking-related columns and raises concerns about reliability. Missingness is also particularly concerning in columns on smoking exposure, children's autism spectrum, and parental management. Considering the dataset's small sample size and large proportion of missingness, imputation is not recommended and could introduce bias, making results less reliable.

## **3. Preliminary Analysis**

In this section, we delve into organizing all of the 78 variables within the dataset. These variables have been systematically grouped into four broad categories: outcomes, exposure, demographic, and Not of Interest.

Outcomes capture variables related to Self-regulation, Externalizing, and Substance Use. This includes parent and child responses to the Brief Problem Monitor (BPM), Emotional Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ), Strengths and Weaknesses of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Symptoms and Normal Behavior Scale (SWAN), as well as Child Substance use variables.

Exposure contains all the variables directly related to SDP and ETS. This included prenatal and postnatal exposure as well as Urine cotinine amounts.

Demographics includes all variables related to parent and child backgrounds. This included variables related to income, race, education, ethnicity, language spoken, and employment status. This is crucial for identifying potential confounding factors during regression.

Variables Not of Interest all seem to have limited direct relevance to the main objectives of the study. They include the Parental Monitoring Questionnaire (excluded due to its lack of connection to the study outcomes for self-regulation) and variables concerning parental substance use in the past six months (excluded for their lack of connection to ETS and SDP variables which were recorded in the latest 5 years postpartum).

### 3.1 Demographic Variables

A thorough examination of demographic variables was conducted, in the interest of brevity and to align with the report's focus, here are the most salient findings. The study's parents had a median age of 37, with an IQR of 35 to 39, and 98% (40 individuals) belonged were of female sex. While 37% (15 individuals) identified with a speaking another language at home, the racial distribution was dominated by White parents at 61%, with NHPI and Other both at 15%. Employment varied, with 54% holding status '2' for Full-Time and parental education spread across categories, with 37% at '3' for some college, additionally the median household income stood at \$48,424. Teenagers aged 12 to 15 were almost equally represented, though about 5% were 16 years old. For teens, 30% identified with speaking another language at home and 42% identified with being Hispanic/Latino, while the race distribution saw White teens at 39%, Biracial/Multiracial at 22%, and Black at 19%. Overall demographic data presented no large issues, however one note is that all variables contained missing data of about 12-25%.

### 3.2 Outcome Variables

![](images/cor_mat_outcomes.jpg){width="362"}

As seen in Figure above, there is a strong correlation among the SWAN and BPM variables related to Attention (att) and Externalizing (ext). After exploring the questionnaires these variables seemed to all be related to a child's externalizing behavior tendencies. Meanwhile, although variables for BPM Internalizing (int) and ERQ data are not as tightly correlated, the questionnaires all focus on a child's ability to emotionally regulate. These two subgroups of externalizing and self-regulation will be used when creating our composite variables for these metrics.

![](images/outcomes_tbl.jpg){width="270"}

Above are the summary statistics for the outcome variables, an immediate observation from the table is the absence of extreme outliers. However, there's one red flag concerning data quality---each of these variables has roughly 20-30% missing data. As stated earlier the significant missing proportion may introduce biases and impact the analysis, warranting further scrutiny of any findings.

### 3.3 Exposure Variables

![](images/cor_mat_exposure.jpg){width="474"}

From the above Figure, we can make out the strong inter-correlation between the prenatal and postnatal smoking exposure variables and cotinine measures. One outlier however is the variable `mom_smoke_pp1`, which showcases a strange negative correlation with some exposure variables, this is most likely due to substantial missing data of about 80% from the column. Additionally, `cotimean_pp6mo_baby`'s weak correlation with other ETS variables suggests it could be capturing different dimensions or aspects of exposure or could be influenced by external factors.

The most alarming finding, however, is the correlation patterns observed within postpartum ETS exposure surveys from studies one and two. There seems to be a clear disjunction between the two studies, likely because parents, in the second study, are trying to recall exposures almost a decade ago. This could introduce a recall bias, which is a grave concern, as this can skew our analysis.

![](images/exposure_tbl_bin.jpg){width="248"}

![](images/exposure_tbl_conjpg.jpg){width="271"}

Upon inspection of the summary statistics for exposure variables, everything seems standard, except for the maximum values for the Cotinine-related variables. A deeper dive into these variables revealed a single extreme outlier, seen in the maximum value for each variable. This child's Cotinine values both ETS and SDP were considerably higher than the rest---almost double the second highest. Notably, the same child also had missing data for various pivotal variables concerning outcomes and demographics, as such they were removed from the dataset.

## **4. Composite Variable Creation**

To simplify the large amount of variables within the dataset, composite variables were developed. These variables amalgamate several related metrics, allowing for an easier analysis. Drawing from the previously discussed groupings in Section 3, composite variables were established for Exposures: SDP and ETS, as well as Outcomes: Self Regulation (SR), Externalizing (EXT), and Substance Use (SU).

Since many of the original variables were a mix of binary and continuous data, various strategies were used to standardize the different metrics. To begin a log transformation was applied to all variables related to Cotinine levels, this was done to reduce the positive skew of the data as many of the values were close to 0 with others being in the several hundred. After this, these values underwent Z-score normalization and then were all made positive with the lowest Z-score given a value of 0. This was done since the next step involved aggregating these new standardized values with the binary data concerning gestational and postpartum smoke exposure variables, with values of 0 signifying no exposure. After taking the average across these exposure values the composite variables for ETS and SDP were complete.

The outcome composite variables follow a similar suit, utilizing Z-score normalization of BPM, ERQ, and SWAN related variables to standardize the different scoring systems used. As said in Section 3, these values were then grouped into EXT and SR to create the composite externalizing and self-regulation metrics. Finally, a composite variable for Substance Use (SU) was generated based on whether the child had ever used marijuana, alcohol, cigarettes, or e-cigarettes before.

### **4.1 Composite Variables: Summary Statistics**

![](images/comp_tbl.jpg){width="254"}

Upon initial observation, the new composite variables were successfully standardized with no extreme outliers. One note however is the striking disparity in missing data percentages between the exposure and outcome groups. While the exposure variables (SDP and ETS) exhibit minimal missing data (both at 2%), the outcome variables present considerably more, ranging from 15% to 25%. This was mainly caused by missing values for one behavioral test being linked to that Child also having missing data for the other behavioral tests. This could certainly impact analyses and should be considered when discussing the limitations of this study.

### **4.2 Interrelation of SDP/ETS**

![](images/plot_ets_sdp.jpg){width="345"}

The figure above illustrates the interrelation between SDP and ETS. Interestingly, there's a discernible bimodal distribution within childrens SDP exposure, suggesting two subgroups - low and high. For visualization purposes these groups will be separated out in following plots. Notably, high levels of SDP exposure appear to coincide with heightened ETS levels. In contrast, low SDP levels don't exhibit a strong association with ETS. This suggests that mothers who smoke during pregnancy (SDP) are potentially more likely to also expose their children to secondhand smoke (ETS) postnatally, whereas mothers who refrain from smoking during pregnancy do not necessarily guarantee an ETS-free environment for their children post-birth.

## **5. Interrelation Between Exposure and Outcomes**

![](images/cor_mat_comp.jpg){width="282"}

The Figure above illustrates the correlation matrix between the exposure and outcome composite variables. From this, we can see the previously discussed strong association between ETS and SDP. Additionally, while both exposure variables are connected to EXT and ER, the correlation with ETS is much stronger. Interestingly, SU does not share a strong correlation with exposure or outcome data, this could be attributed to the 25% missing data and potential issues stemming from response bias.

### **5.1 Effect of ETS and SDP on Self-Regulation**

![](images/sr_plot.jpg){width="345"}

The visualization above highlights the relationship that ETS exposure increases SR also increases signaling worse child self-regulation capabilities. This relation is similar between SDP and SR, albeit with a milder trend.

A rudimentary linear regression model was then created to examine the effects of ETS and SDP on self-regulation. It's vital to note that this model's variable selection was rudimentary. The initial model encompassed all demographic variables, which were then pruned based on their significance. Models were juxtaposed before and after this pruning using ANOVA.

The model was formulated as: `SR ~ SDP + ETS + page + pethnic + pwhite + prace_other + tage + language + tethnic + taian` with covariates being selected from parent and child demographic data. Notably, ETS was found to be statistically significant with a p-value of 0.041 and an estimated coefficient of 0.710, with a standard error of 0.329 meaning controlling for all other factors for every point increase in ETS we would expect a .710 point increase in child SR levels. Important to note is that this model has an Adjusted R-squared: 0.3734, indicating that there remains a significant proportion of variance in SR that is not accounted for. Lastly, pethnic and prace_other were also found to be statistically significant in this model.

### **5.2 Effect of ETS and SDP on Externalizing** Behavior

![](images/ext_plot.jpg){width="341"}

Similar to the effects of ETS on Self-regulation, as a child's ETS score increases so does the degree of externalizing behaviors. The relationship of SDP to externalizing behaviors, on the other hand, seems relatively indistinct, although the previous correlation analysis did indicate a mild positive relationship.

Applying a linear regression model, using a similar variable selection approach used in the self-regulation model, was formulated as: `EXT ~ SDP + ETS + pethnic + tage + language + taian + tblack`. Interestingly, this model did not achieve statistical significance, evidenced by an Adjusted R-squared value of 0.1539. One explanation for this might be the weak correlation between BPM Internalizing and ERQ variables, potentially rendering the composite Externalizing variable less reliable in this context.

### **5.3 Effect of ETS and SDP on Substance Use**

![](images/su_plot.jpg){width="337"}

As seen in the figure above for children exhibiting low SDP levels, there's a noticeable pattern where increased substance use aligns with heightened ETS exposure. Surprisingly, within the high SDP level bracket, however, an increase in SU seems to be paired with diminished ETS. This divergence could potentially be attributed to the constrained sample size, with only 2 cases of children at a high SDP level registering an SU of 1, and only 5 cases at an SU of 0.

Utilizing a logistic regression model, echoing the variable selection methodology from previous models, was formulated as: `SU ~ SDP + ETS + pethnic + employ + pedu + income + tage + language + tethnic`. Interestingly, this exploration found neither SDP nor ETS to be statistically relevant. The sole significant determinant emerged as tage, bearing a p-value of 0.0468. Additionally, deviance analysis presented a null deviance of 32.055 (with 28 degrees of freedom) and a residual deviance of 16.307 (with 19 degrees of freedom). The reduction in deviance indicates the model with predictors is a better fit than the null model, but it still has an unexplained variance, pointing to potential missing factors or complexities.

## **6.** Limitations

During this analysis, several potential limitations to using this dataset were discovered. Firstly, a striking concern arose from the substantial missing data in crucial columns, which could potentially distort findings. Given the modest sample size of only 49 participants, it's debatable how effectively observations can be generalized. With several notable variables such as child substance use and postnatal smoke exposure having large amounts of data missing, the robustness of any conclusions made will certainly be effected.

Another challenge was found in the form of recall biases; this was particularly evident from the disparities between postpartum ETS exposure surveys across two distinct studies. In the latter study, parents were tasked with recalling exposures from nearly a decade ago, possibly compromising the accuracy of their responses. Lastly, the regression models, despite shedding light on significant relationships, were rooted in a rather basic variable selection process. This rudimentary approach might have either missed key confounding factors or tailored the models too closely to our specific sample.

## 7. Conclusion

In this report preliminary exploratory data analysis on the potential effects of SDP and ETS on children's self-regulation, externalizing behavior, and substance use, early findings suggest possible negative implications of both SDP and ETS. ETS, in particular, appeared to have a significant impact on children's self-regulation. Our EDA also indicated a potential relationship between SDP and ETS, suggesting that mothers who smoked during pregnancy might also expose their children to secondhand smoke postnatally. However, these are initial insights, and the connection between these exposures and outcomes requires further examination. This EDA serves as a starting point for guiding more in-depth work in the future.
