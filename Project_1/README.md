# Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

## Smoke Exposure & Children's Behavioral Outcomes
This project delves deep into understanding the ramifications of Smoke Exposure during Pregnancy (SDP) and Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) on children's behavioral outcomes. A collaboration with Dr. Lauren Micalizzi from the Department of Behavioral and Social Sciences, this research sheds light on a pertinent public health issue.

## Background
Exposure to smoking during pregnancy (SDP) and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) are among the most hazardous exposures a child can face.

- 7-15% of infants are exposed to SDP annually.
- Over 25% of children encounter household ETS.
- The economic toll of SDP amounts to a staggering $4 billion every year in health-care costs.

Such early smoke exposure elevates the risk of:

- Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.
- Substance use problems.
- Self-regulation problems (maintaining physiological, emotional, behavioral, and cognitive control).

## Research Objective
The primary goal of this research is to study the correlation between SDP & ETS exposure and:

- Self-regulation
- Externalizing behavior
- Substance use
