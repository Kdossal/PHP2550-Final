# Project 3: Simulation Study

## Cardiovascular Risk Prediction Model Transportability Analysis

This folder hosts the analysis for a collaborative project with Dr. Jon Steingrimsson, focused on evaluating the transportability of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk prediction models from the Framingham Heart Study to the NHANES population. It includes preprocessing steps, predictive modeling, and a simulation study to examine model generalizability. The findings, code, and methodology documented are part of a project for understanding the applicability of CVD risk prediction across diverse demographic settings.
